# register_app

A simple application for recording data that can be used as a base example for an even larger system. Feel free to give your suggestions for improvement. Remembering that I am still an intermediate level programmer, I have a lot to learn. The application is still under development. I'm slowly implementing more functions and fixing some annoying bugs.
